Max came to us through a rescue mission from a litter of puppies found in an inhabitable situation.  He gets along with the other animals here at the shelter and absolutely adores children.  He also loves going for a long walk through the dog park. Max has also had all of his shots and is ready to take home today!</p>

Wyatt is a little sensitive to other animals however but has no problem enjoying time with the kids or just a single friend.
