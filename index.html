                <h4>Meet Max our Snow White sweetheart!</h4>
                <p>He’s part poodle/yorke mix and full of love.  At the age of four he’s got plenty of spunk but also settles down to cuddle.  Max came to us through a rescue mission from a litter of puppies found in an inhabitable situation.  He gets along with the other animals here at the shelter and adores children.  He also loves going for a long walk through the dog park. Max has also had all of his shots and is ready to take home today!</p>

                <h4>Our sad little bear.</h4>
                <p>A Pomeranian breed that has been feeling a little lonely since its owner dropped it off.  Sadly bear doesn’t get a long with other animals but has an insatiable love for children.  He also loves to cuddle and lay about on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Bear has been to the vet several times and is now up to date on all of his shots.  He prefers being groomed with a soft brush to make sure that poof stays in tact.</p>

                <h4>Dirty Snowball</h4>
                <p>This little kitten is full of life.  She loves to play, climb and chase her friends around the center.  Her curious nature makes for an amusingly fun time.  She has been both spayed and declawed.  All of her vet papers are up to date making her perfect for apartment living.  She was found in an abandoned warehouse and could really use a good loving place to call home.</p>
